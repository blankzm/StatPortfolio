# Statistics and Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains various examples of statistical analysis I have performed, highlighting the work I have done in various statistics and data analytics classes at Miami University.

### Files Included:

* **RiceAnalysis.html** - Knitted html of an analysis I conducted in the program R that looks at a data set containing physiochemical properties and textural measures of rice. This project includes a multiple regression model and corresponding analysis, as well as a prediction of a variable based on given values.

* **breakSticksR.html** - Knitted html of an R program that uses statistical methods to look at distributions of breakpoints in a stick with a length of 1 unit. 

* **breakSticksPython.py** - python file containing answers to the same questions from breakSticksR.html, written and solved using python instead of R.
